SONIC ADVANCE LEVEL RIP
-----------------------

1) CREDITS
The tilesets contained within were originally created by SEGA 
and Dimps.  The rip was created via an automated process by 
Techokami, with information and help from JoseTB & Retriever II.

If you use the contents of this package, you must give credit
to SEGA, Dimps, and Techokami.

If you did not download this tileset from the following domains:
http://holenet.info/
http://www.spriters-resource.com/
http://www.sonicfangameshq.com/
http://www.themfz.com/
then you should immediately start yelling at the webmaster for
mirroring this file without permission.
PROTIP: If you ask first, I'll almost always say yes!

2) THE RIPPING PROCESS
Sonic Advance level tiles are stored uncompressed in the ROM.
The pallete starts before the tiles, and the 96x96 mappings are
a short distance from the end of the tiles. A PHP script was made
to automate the process of building the 96x96 tiles into images
that are then numbered and saved. The script is available under a
BSD license (e.g. do whatever you want, but give credit) from
holenet.info at the following locations:
SONIC ADVANCE 1: http://holenet.info/junks/sadv1_levelrip.phps
SONIC ADVANCE 2: http://holenet.info/junks/sadv2_levelrip.phps
SONIC ADVANCE 3: http://holenet.info/junks/sadv3_levelrip.phps

3) EXPLANATION OF TILESET
Due to a limitation on the GBA graphical system, you cannot have
tile priority, only layer priority. In order to have parts of the
level appear in front of Sonic, it is formed by combining layers
BG2 (bottom) and BG3 (top) with the Object layer in between.

The levels are built from 96x96 pixel blocks. Do NOT alter their
dimensions or they will NOT work correctly!

The background itself is completely separate from the block and
tile data, so they have not been ripped. They will not be ripped.
DO NOT ASK FOR BACKGROUND RIPS.
